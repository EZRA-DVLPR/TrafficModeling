\section{Challenges}

What challenges have occurred for this week?

We have continued to have difficulty looking for reliable sources of traffic information.
It seems that there is not much publicly available information within recent years.
There is also no general consensus as to how the data should be structured; Some provide daily tracking, some offer hourly updates, and others offer yearly summaries.

Another area we had encountered difficulty with, was knowing which API were available and applicable for our project.
We wanted to utilize Google Maps API, but this seems to require a server to establish a connection to the Google API.
As such, we have reduced the scale of the project, but hope to add this functionality in the future.
There also exists a Python repository that automatically connects to the Google API's, but we are unsure of whether it provides the features we require.

We will continue to look for good and useful sources of traffic information.
Additionally, we will be searching for API we can implement for the project, without adding much complexity.
