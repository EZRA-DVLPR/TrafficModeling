\section{Challenges}

What challenges have occurred for this week? Currently, there is an issue somewhere with the pathfinding code that it won't start moving towards the end goal post (green cube shown above) and there is an issue with the playerwalk variable, which hopefully is an easy fix. There was a challenge with implementing the NavMesh, since it is (or soon will be) a deprecated  system in Unity that you need to go out of your way to download through package managing in Unity. The AI window is not a part of Unity by default, that we just needed to download that seperately.
