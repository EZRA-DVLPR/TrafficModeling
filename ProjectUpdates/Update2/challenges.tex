\section{Challenges}

What challenges have occurred for this week?

Currently, there is an issue somewhere with the pathfinding code that it won't start moving towards the end goal post (green cube shown above) and there is an issue with the playerwalk variable, which hopefully is an easy fix. There was a challenge with implementing the NavMesh, since it is (or soon will be) a deprecated  system in Unity that you need to go out of your way to download through package managing in Unity. The AI window is not a part of Unity by default, that we just needed to download that seperately. 

Getting the MLAgents repository to be downloaded took lots of IT work. Environment variables were changed, new paths were added, and new pytohn installations were necessary. Additionally, there were a myriad of packages to install and load into the sample unity project provided by the MLAgents developers. All in all, it took a long time to configure and was a headache to straighten out.
