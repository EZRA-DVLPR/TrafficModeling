\section{Challenges}

What challenges have occurred for this week?

Finding the desired information within the documentation including: Traffic Management System, Models, and so forth.
It seems that there is a lot of documentation for one of the Related Works: "Open-Source CiThruS Simulation Environment for Real-Time 360-Degree Traffic Imaging".
We are looking into additional related works that implement features that would make the development process easier.
The problem lies in that at the moment, we are unsure of what exactly we need until we stumble upon it's existence, such as the traffic control system.
