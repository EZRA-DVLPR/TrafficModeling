\section{Challenges}

What challenges have occurred for this week?

A challenge we had with the implementing the pathfinding scene into the main Unity scene was configuring the correct places that the agent is allowed to traverse.

  \end{figure}

The blue represents the path that the program will let the car traverse. This is a problem because the mesh covers every part of the plain but the actual road that we want the car to stick to. Fortunately, this isn't a very hard fix but just took a good amount of research. We just need to make sure the "Navigation Static" option below was ticked off.

Additionally, there's currently a problem that the model for the Sedan is by default upright, so we'd need to change the model somehow.
