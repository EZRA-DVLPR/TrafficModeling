\section{Logical View}

The logical view provides a conceptual model of the software's architecture and its components. 
This includes how the software is organized and how its different parts work together.
This will be the largest section of the document.

\subsection{High-Level Design (Architecture)}

insert an image showing how the different components connect together to form the project

Should be a layered image for each section of the project from unity to connecting to the python script, pathfinding, etc.

each layer should be explained as well

\subsection{Detailed Class Design}

should show a list of all functions and classes used to create the project

all classes/functions should have:
-dependencies
-Methods
-output
-purpose
