\section{Introduction}

This document describes the work put in to create a program that runs in Unity to model traffic in 3D.
It allows for users to determine a start position, as well as a desired ending position which will follow traffic rules to ensure a legal and fast guide.

\subsection{Background}

Traffic congestion is a very common experience for those in Los Angeles \cite{CNN}.
In order to address this problem many apps such as Waze and Google Maps were created \cite{TraffApps}.
Following in the style of these applications, we wanted to create software that follows a similar purpose: to provide a good model for traffic flow and path to a destination with this information.
