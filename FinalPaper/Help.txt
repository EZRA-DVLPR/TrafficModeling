Help!

General Tips:

- You can download LaTeX from here: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

- I use my Laptop with MacOS so I also utilize this program to compile and sometimes write in LaTeX.
It's called TeXShop: https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/.
IDK if it's Windows compatible, but as long as you can compile the LaTeX docs, then it doesn't really matter.

- Compile 3-5 times every time you want to see the changes to the document.
LaTeX is VERY very weird in the sense that you have to compile multiple times.
This is because each compilation utilizes information that is gained from the previous compilation.
If images or graphs or tables, etc. dont show, then re-compiling should fix it.
This is normal and expected behavior.

- Only compile the main .tex file: that being the `finalPaper.tex`
This reduces the amount of auxiliary files created by LaTeX during compilation.

- I've attached a document in the `Sample` Folder, complete with Images, and auxiliary files.
The main file is `Sample.tex`
This is to be used as an outline to rip code from so you don't have to always be looking things up on the interwebs.
It does a lot of different things, like make tables, add images, import other files, and more.
Feel free to rip whatever you want from it, that doc has been used from me and others for at least 3 years now.
In fact, sometimes I add to it, so if you find anything interesting or cool you want to add feel free to add to it!

- Work on individual files then import them into the main `finalPaper.tex` file.
This helps reduce the amount of conflicts we may encounter.

- To use a citation type: `\cite[NAMEGIVEN]`
The `NAMEGIVEN` should match EXACTLY to the name in the `bibitem{NAMEGIVEN}` within the bibliography

- Comments can be written with the `%` character at the beginning of the line.
Multi-line comments can be written in a few ways:
    1) using the default packages:
        \iffalse
            Comment line 1
            Comment line 2
        \fi

    2) using the verbatim package, you can write:
        \begin{comment}
            Commented line 1
            Commented line 2
        \end{comment}

- We will need to combine the work from the weekly updates to the final document.
We will most likely do that at the end, since it will basically just frontload the doc with padding.

- Save images within the `Images` folder.
We will use this folder for all images needed for the final paper.
Each progress update also will use the image folder within that folder.
